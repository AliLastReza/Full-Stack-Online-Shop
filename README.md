# Full-Stack-Online-Shop

It's a full stack working online shop, we'll name it later :)

## What It's going to be?

1. It better be full stack and complete in this sense
2. It should work. It's ok to have bugs but overall it should work
3. It will get better day by day with a incremental life cycle
4. It's a real world project. meaning, a shop can use this project for its customers and it should be good enough

### How to accomplish that? and what are the details?

1. I use docker and docker-compose
2. Django for backend
3. Frontend, hasn't decided yet
4. It should have some basic unit tests
5. Every day I will make it batter
6. I work some sort of agile. Maybe 2 weeks on back and 2 week on front
7. I better declare what kind of shop it's going to be? which shops can use it? what are client's requirements?
