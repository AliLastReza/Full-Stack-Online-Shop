# Online Shop Project's Requirements

It's a online shop optimized for small local shops to enter to the online world and start their journey by selling products to their city's customers

## General Idea

* It's not going to be a big project, because our clients are small local shops
* However it's going to optimized in all sides for their needs and success
* At first It's going to fulfill all sorts of small local shops and later will see what to do and where to go
* It's full stack, complete, and good enough
* **First step, reach to a MVP**



## Client's Requirements

And I know what I'm going to create is going to suck.

* This shop should work properly and then we can create forks for different countries and currencies
* A Home page UI/UX that feel like your at a small shop. Picture of seller, products and some notices around him.
* Products management for a small shop
* Product catalog/listing management
* Home page management
* Cart
* Checkout
* Shipping
* Stock/Shelf management
* Delivery
